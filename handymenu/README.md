# Handymenu

## AppImage specification

Tested: Debian Buster.

Image: Debian Buster

The AppImage has patched path because they are hardcoded in the source

## Use

Running the Appimage will make a $HOME/.handymenu folder.

##  Note

The default configuration is hardcoded in the code and will not work at second launch because it uses hardcoded path that are in the Appimage directory.
You can either copy them manually or edit them with your own icons.
