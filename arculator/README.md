# Arculator

## AppImage specification

Tested: Debian Buster.

Image: Debian Buster

The AppImage contain only the application, there are still few directories that are needed that are copied

## Use

Launching the AppImage is enough, but I didn't try any games.

##  Note

A future version may maybe contain the directories in the AppImage, but it's not in my priority.
