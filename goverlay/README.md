## AppImage specification

Tested: Debian Buster.

Image: Debian Buster because we need a version of Lazarus recent enough.

The AppImage contain the libraries for MangoHud and vkBasalt. It contain also vkcube and glxgears for having a preview.

## Use

The global settings are not really usefull because the AppImage use but the configuration are writed in your `$HOME`.

So it's possible to use the AppImage for making your configuration for MangoHud and vkBasalt.

##  Note

ReplaySorcery is not added yet to the AppImage and MangoHud and vkBasalt are activated manually by force with `VK_LAYER_PATH` and `VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS`
